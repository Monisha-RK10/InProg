# Real-Time 3D-Aware Object Perception and Proximity Warning System

Note: Person is mapped to Cyclist for visual purpose. This is fine for now because this project does not consider evaluation with MOT/IoU. In case,you need better mapping technique, please consider my earlier project [Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking on KITTI with ROS 2, YOLOv8 & BYTETrack] (https://github.com/Monisha-RK10/Real-Time-Multi-Object-Tracking-on-KITTI-with-ROS-2-YOLOv8-BYTETrack), where I implemented cyclist filter.
